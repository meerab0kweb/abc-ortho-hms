##Microsoft SQL Server Database Project

This project was developed by a group of four students as part of an academic assignment. The goal was to **design and implement a real-life Hospital Management System (HMS) database** using Microsoft SQL Server.

---
##Project Overview
The database system simulates core functionalities of an orthopedic hospital, focusing on patient care, appointments, treatments, and administrative data. It supports robust data handling, structured querying, and enforces data integrity.

##Project Scope & Objectives
The major focus of the project includes:

###Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling
- Describes all **entities**, **relationships**, and **attributes**
- ER diagram used to visualize the structure and relationships

###Database Schema Design
- Creation of well-structured tables
- Appropriate data types and primary/foreign key constraints
- Implementation of:
  - **CHECK constraints**
  - **NOT NULL constraints**
  - **DEFAULT values**
  - **Triggers** for business rules

###Normalization
- All relations were **normalized up to 3rd Normal Form (3NF)** to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity

###Data Loading
- SQL scripts to populate tables with **sample hospital data**
- INSERT statements ensure realistic records

###SQL Queries & Transactions
- Includes essential and advanced SQL queries such as:
  - Retrieval of patient records
  - Appointment scheduling
  - Doctors and specialties filtering
  - Transactional control using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`
